abstract = {The explosive growth of e-commerce and online environments has made the issue of information
search and selection increasingly serious; users are overloaded by options to consider
and they may not have the time or knowledge to personally evaluate these options.
Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with
the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools
in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation
have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully
deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume,
is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields,
such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology,
data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing,
and consumer behavior. Theoreticians and practitioners from these fields continually
seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems.
This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a
coherent and unified repository of recommender systems major concepts, theories, methodologies,
trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety
of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included. Recommender Systems
Handbook illustrates how this technology can support the user in decision-making,
planning and purchasing processes. It works for well known corporations such as Amazon,
Google, Microsoft and AT&T. This handbook is suitable for researchers and advanced-level
students in computer science as a reference.}

@article{NETFLIX, title={Deep Learning for Recommender Systems: A Netflix Case Study}, volume={42}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/18140}, DOI={10.1609/aimag.v42i3.18140}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has profoundly impacted many areas of machine learning. However, it took a while for its impact to be felt in the field of recommender systems. In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep-learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well-tuned non-deep-learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep-learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep-learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offlineâ€“online metric (mis-)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep-learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep-learning and non-deep-learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take-aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={3}, journal={AI Magazine}, author={Steck, Harald and Baltrunas, Linas and Elahi, Ehtsham and Liang, Dawen and Raimond, Yves and Basilico, Justin}, year={2021}, month={Nov.}, pages={7-18} }
